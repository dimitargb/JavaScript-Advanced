The Architecture will give our Project the Strucutre in wich we cvan than write a code.
So jsut like a hint, Softwere needs a Strucutre. In the Softwere structure means how we organize and divide the code
into diffrent modules, classea and functions. All this holds our code together and we call it a Structure.

The next reason for Architecture is called Maintainability. Wheh we build a Project we allways need to thiink about the future
and keep in mind the Project is never really done., will will always need to chnage things in the future and we will need 
to maintain the Project. This works just if the Project is nicely structured and we mide add a new features to the Project
which brings us Expandability.

Expandability is basiccaly the ability to easily add new Features in the future. This si only possible with a good Structure
and a good overall Architecture. The perfect Architecture combines all those three aspects of Structure, Maintainability
and Expandability.

In order to achive this we use well established architecture patterns like MVC, MVP, Flux.

We can also use a Framework like React, Angular, Vue, Svelte to take care of the architecture especiallu for large applications.

Any Architecture must have the following Components - Business Logic, State, Http Library, Application Logic, Presentation Logic
