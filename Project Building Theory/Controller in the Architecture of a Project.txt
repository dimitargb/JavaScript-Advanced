We need something to connect the Model and the View form the Architecture Compoments.
This is the Controller.
The Controller will hanfdle the event for exsample a Click event, because handling an event is doing something in the Application.
This si clearly part of the Application Logic. This handling may invilve updating the User Interface and also ask the 
Model for soem Data.
So we can say that the Controller dispatches tasks to Model and to the View. It controlles and orechestrates the entire action.
It organises the whole Application. Asking the Model for some Data might involve doing an AJAX request to the Web.
This is exactely what the Model does. After the Data arrives the Controller takes the Data and sends it to the View.
Finally the View will render that Data to the User Interface and finish the cicle.
The Controller imports  and calls functions from the Model and the View.

In our application first User selects the Recipe and the Page loads with the resipe ID. this is hndled by the Controller 
Than the Controller sends this Data to the Model asynchronusly gets the Data from the API. 
Once the Data has arrived the Controller assk for that Data, recieves it and sends it to the View, wich will render the 
Recipe on the screen.
