We want when we bokkmark an recipe we want that recipe to show up in the right corner in the Bookmarks section.
In the index.html in the Bookmarks we have the preview element. This is a list element with the class of preview in it.
So now we create a bookmarksView.js in the views Folder.

What we want to do now is that whenever a new Bookmark is added, we want to render the bookmarksView with all the bookmarks.
This means with the array of the bookmarks.
This is in the controller in the controlAddBookmark() function.

What needs to be done yet irthat each time that we diplay a recipe we should update the entire bookmarks panel,
so it can select the curent recipe.

We do this in the controlRecipes function in the cotroller.js

 // Update results view to mark selected search result
    resultsView.update(model.getSearchResultsPage());
    bookmarksView.update(model.state.bookmarks);

Now we have to create antoher view called previewView, so we can swithch between bookmarksView and resultsView.
