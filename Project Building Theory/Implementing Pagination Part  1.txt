In order to render a certain nuber of results on a Page we use Pagination.
For exsample in our Project we want to render 10 results of serched data and the next on a next page.
So we go to controlSearchResults -> resultsView.render(model.state.search.results); 
We dont want to rder all results bur just 10 results. We basucally need to create a function in the model
wich will take in teh page that we want to render and which will than only return the results that we want to render.
for that page.

So we create a new function in our model.js called getSearchResultsPage().
We calculate the start and end of the page and we write the function. Than this should go into the state.
We call it resultsPerPage.

export const getSearchResultsPage = function (page = state.search.page) {
  state.search.page = page;

  const start = (page - 1) * state.search.resultsPerPage;  //0;
  const end = page * state.search.resultsPerPage;   //9;

    return state.search.results.slice(start, end)
}

Now we go back to the controller and in the render results we write:
resultsView.render(model.getSearchResultsPage());

In out model we shoud store the Page number that is coming in the state. We put here that the page: 1;
Also in the getSearchResultsPage  function we put:
state.search.page = page;

So now even if we dont put one or two in the getSearchResultsPage() it will alwyas starts with one.
