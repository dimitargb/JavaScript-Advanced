Storing data in LocalStorage is all about data. This will be implemented in the model.js.
When should the bokkmarks be stored to LocalStorage, this happends whenever the user bookmarks a recipe and 
also when the user unbookmarks a recipe. In this cases the current bookmarks array needs to be stored in LocalStorage.
 So we need to create a new function called persistBookmarks() in the model.js.

 const persistBookmarks = function() {
  localStorage.setItem('bookmarks', JSON.stringify(state.bookmarks));
}

Now what we have to do is to call this function in the addBookmark function and deleteBookmark function.
What we need to do now is to run a method which will render the bookmarks into the BOOKMARKS section,
after the page has been reloadet.

The first step is to get the bookmarks out of local storage and back in our code and after that we can then render them
back to the BOOKMARKS section.

So we write the code for taking the bokkings out from the local storage in the model.js
We write initialisation function called init() function. In there we need to do the opposit:

 localStorage.getItem('bookmarks') and we need also to store that somewhere so it is:
 const storage = localStorage.getItem('bookmarks');
