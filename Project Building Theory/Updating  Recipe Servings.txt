We add another Controller function. In the controller.js we crate another function controlServings().
The update is happening in the model not in the controller. So in the model we will have a method called updateServings().
And then we can pass in the new servings.So let's say updateServings(6) we pass six inside.
Now lets' go to the model and implement this:
The function will take in the number of servings (newServings) for example (6);

export const updateServings = function(newServings){
  state.recipe.ingredients.forEach(ingredient => {
    ingredient.quantity = ingredient.quantity * newServings / state.recipe.servings;
    // newQuantity = oldQuantity * newServings/ oldServings
  });

  state.recipe.servings = newServings;
};

What this function will do is to reach into the state and particualt into the recipe ingredients and than change the 
quantity in each ingredient which is an object wich contains the quantity. This quantity we want to change.

We also need to update the Servings in the state -> state.recipe.servings = newServings;

Now we go back to the controller and than we need to update the recipeView.
recipeView.render(model.state.recipe) ->  // Update the reicpeView.

After that we cal theis new controlServings function in the init function.

What we will do now is to create a new eventlistener in the recipeView when we press a button.
So we create a new method addHandler. The best way to do this is eventDelegation to the buttons.
We can listen for enets on the parentElement and than check if the click target was one of those buttons.
So we use the closest() method which us very usefull for eventDeleagtion and we use the btn--tiny class
to reach those buttons. 
Now we need to connect this with the controller in the init function in the controller.js
In order to get to the buttons to increase or decrease value to the buttons we need to use the data Properties.
So we add new property to the buttons for increase and decrease and this way we can red the value of those
properies in the addEventListener function. 
In the buttons with btn--increase-servings we adfd new property data-update-to=""
